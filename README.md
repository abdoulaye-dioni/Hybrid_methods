# Hybrid_methods


When handling missing data under the MAR assumption, many studies compare classical methods. 
However, several questions remain: Is parametric multiple imputation an ideal benchmark? 
Is non-parametric multiple imputation sufficient to effectively handle missing values? 
The same question applies to semi-parametric methods. The answer is not always straightforward. 
Indeed, just as a single imputed value may struggle to fully capture the notion of plausible values \cite{Little2020}, 
a single approach may also struggle to capture the complexity of real data. 
To overcome these limitations, hybrid methods that combine the strengths of classical methods are emerging as a promising alternative. 
Hybrid methods integrate at least two classical methods of handling missing data into a unified procedure. 
They offer great flexibility and robustness by combining methods with different implementations.
